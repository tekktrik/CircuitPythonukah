# CircuitPythonukiah
Hardware required for the CircuitPythonukiah project

## Hardware Dependencies
Here are all the things needed: to physically build your very own CircuitPythonukiah:

### Custom Components

The project makes use of two custom parts. The first is the custom PCB that is the heart
of the CIrcuitPythonukiah.  The second is a base that can be 3D printed, which holds the
PCB upright.  You can find the PCB KiCAD design and fabrication files in the
`electrical/` folder, and you can find both the PCB's STEP file representation, as well
as the STEP and STL files for the base in the `mechanical/` folder.

### Mechanical (Off-The-Shelf)

This project uses the following physical materials:

* 3D printed frames (FDM)
* Fasteners

### Electronics (Off-The-Shelf)
This project uses the following electronics materials:

* [QT Py ESP32-S2 Dev Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325) (x1)
* [Piezo Buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/160) (x1)
